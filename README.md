# vuejs-animateonscroll

Animate on scroll with Vue JS. These kinds of animations are popular these days and there are also popular libraries for this kind of stuff, like ScrollMagic or GSAP. 
But I donâ€™t wanna use one of these. 
I like to implement this feature without any additional library or tool.

We can create a custom directive for this. Vue.js have many core directives, 
like v-model or v-show for example, but we can create our own directive. 
And you can use this on any element or component you want.

You can find a detailed explanation in my YouTube tutorial.
